The ``smarts`` module contains functions for calling SMARTS: Simple Model of the
Atmoshperic Radiative Transfer of Sunshine, from NREL, developed by 
Dr. Christian Gueymard. 

SMARTS software can be obtained from:

honor itâ€™s license, and download the SMART files into their PVLib folder.

originally coded in Matlab by Juan Russo (2001), updated and ported to python
by Silvana Ayala (2019-2020). Original Matlab wrapper was made for graduate studies
